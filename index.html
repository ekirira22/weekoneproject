        <span id="lock"><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2></span>
        <p>Just as from the logo my name is Eric, the rest is "Kirira Maranga".
          A name am proud of Im a Humanoid who was born in Karatina,Nyeri and raised in Nairobi
          I completed my Highschool on 2014 November, my Primary school at 2010 November.
          Currently am a student in the Catholic University of Eastern Africa undertaking computer science as my major
          course.Which has been my passion since i was of a tender age, i always loved computers.
          My life has mainly been of ups and downs but, hey i still made it and now am at Moringa school, a coding school
          and you may ask why i joined Moringa and am a computer science student. Well maybe its beacause i realised that \
          Kenya teaches computer science in a very boring and traditional way.
          Anyway, besides that am a christian with two good parents and siblings, and God knows am a
          kind-hearted person who loves people, though i dont show it (whats the point) .
          With all that said i also love music especially urban hip-hop, i love dancing, i love selfies..lol and
          also love programming.</p>

          Something most people dont know is that im a photographer(in association with ess touch) who loves taking people pictures
          and also loves photos of me being taken too. I started learnig and appreciating photography immideately
